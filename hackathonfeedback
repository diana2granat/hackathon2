Project: Budget Management

- The project demonstrates proficiency in setting up a basic Express server with routing and handling POST requests.
- Notably, the use of bcrypt for password hashing and validation is a strong security measure.
- However, consider incorporating frontend validation for a better user experience and error handling.
- Additionally, while the backend functionality is implemented, showcasing the frontend would provide a more comprehensive view of the project.

Express Server Setup: 8/10
Routing and Middleware: 7/10
Security (bcrypt): 9/10
Frontend Validation: 6/10

Overall: 7.5/10

In your uploaded video, only the code was demonstrated without showcasing the working frontend.
Including the frontend would offer a complete perspective of the project's functionality and user interface. Consider providing access to the frontend in future submissions for a more comprehensive evaluation.
